# Ardougne Cooldown Timer

Marks of grace have a cooldown between spawning. A technique called force spawning allows you to run a lap of the Ardougne agility course, teleport to a bank for skilling, then return to the Ardougne course 3 minutes later for a 2/3 chance to obtain a mark of grace. This plugin creates an infobox, and optionally a notification, to return to the course to run another lap.
